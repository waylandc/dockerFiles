Just started playing with Docker for my Deep Learning adventures so 
here's a collection of the Dockerfiles I've created to build my
development environments.

Note that in the shell scripts I've made, I've added stuff to fix the 
problem of not being able to open DISPLAY for GUI apps from within a container.
